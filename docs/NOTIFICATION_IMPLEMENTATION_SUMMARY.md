# Real-Time Notifications - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend Implementation
- ✅ Installed Pusher server SDK (`pusher`)
- ✅ Completed full CRUD API in `netlify/functions/notifications.ts`:
  - `GET /api/notifications` - List user's notifications
  - `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread count
  - `POST /api/notifications` - Create notification (broadcasts via Pusher)
  - `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark as read
  - `PATCH /api/notifications/read-all` - Mark all as read
  - `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification
- ✅ Created notification helper utilities (`netlify/functions/utils/notifications.ts`):
  - `sendWelcomeNotification()` - New user registration
  - `sendAppointmentReminder()` - 24h before appointment
  - `sendAppointmentCancelled()` - Appointment cancelled
  - `sendAppointmentRescheduled()` - Appointment date changed
  - `sendVaccinationDue()` - Vaccination overdue
  - `sendMedicationReminder()` - Medication administration
  - `sendMedicalUpdate()` - Vet updated records
  - `sendPasswordChanged()` - Security alert
  - `sendSystemAlert()` - Admin announcements
- ✅ Integrated automatic notifications:
  - Welcome notification on registration
  - Password change security alerts
  - Note: Other notification types are available but not wired by default

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Installed Pusher client SDK (`pusher-js`)
- ✅ Created `NotificationBell` component (`frontend/src/components/Notification/NotificationBell.tsx`):
  - Bell icon with unread count badge
  - Dropdown with recent notifications
  - Mark as read, delete, mark all as read actions
  - Real-time toast notifications on arrival
  - Priority-based styling (high=orange, normal=blue, low=gray)
  - Relative timestamps ("5m ago", "2h ago")
- ✅ Created `usePusher` hook (`frontend/src/hooks/use-pusher.ts`):
  - Manages Pusher connection lifecycle
  - Subscribes to user-specific channel: `user-{userId}`
  - Listens for `notification-created` events
  - Handles connection/subscription state logging
  - Callback registration for notification handlers
- ✅ Integrated NotificationBell in all dashboards:
  - `PetOwnerDashboard`
  - `VeterinarianDashboard`
  - `AdminDashboard`

### 3. Configuration
- ✅ Updated `.env.example` with Pusher credentials
- ✅ Updated `frontend/.env.production.example` with Pusher keys
- ✅ TypeScript compilation verified (no errors)

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive guide: `06-REALTIME-NOTIFICATIONS.md`
  - Setup instructions (Pusher account, env vars)
  - Architecture explanation
  - Developer usage guide
  - Notification types reference
  - Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Updated `README.md`:
  - Added "Real-Time Notifications" to key highlights
  - Marked WebSocket feature as completed
  - Added link to notification guide

### Dependencies Installed:
- **Backend:** `pusher` (27 packages)
- **Frontend:** `pusher-js` (4 packages)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Backend Event** → Serverless function calls notification helper (e.g., `sendWelcomeNotification`)
2. **Database Insert** → Notification saved to `notifications` table
3. **Pusher Broadcast** → Notification published to `user-{userId}` channel with event `notification-created`
4. **Frontend Receives** → `usePusher` hook receives event, invokes callbacks
5. **UI Updates** → NotificationBell updates badge, shows toast, adds to dropdown list

### Example Flow (User Registration)

```
User registers
    ↓
auth.ts calls sendWelcomeNotification(userId, userName)
  ↓
utils/notifications.ts inserts into DB
    ↓
Pusher.trigger('user-{userId}', 'notification-created', notification)
    ↓
usePusher.ts receives event in frontend
    ↓
NotificationBell increments badge, shows toast
    ↓
User sees notification instantly
```

## 🔐 Security Model

- **Channel Isolation:** Each user has private channel `user-{userId}`
- **Backend Validation:** JWT authentication ensures correct userId
- **Frontend Subscription:** Only subscribes to own channel
- **Public Keys:** `VITE_PUSHER_KEY` is safe to expose (read-only)
- **Secret Keys:** `PUSHER_SECRET` never exposed to frontend

## 📝 Next Steps (Setup Required)

To enable real-time notifications in your deployment:

### 1. Create Pusher Account
- Go to https://dashboard.pusher.com
- Create a free account
- Create new "Channels" app
- Get credentials (App ID, Key, Secret, Cluster)

### 2. Set Environment Variables

**Local Development (`.env`):**
```bash
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_app_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_app_secret
PUSHER_CLUSTER=us2
```

**Frontend (`.env` or `.env.local`):**
```bash
VITE_PUSHER_KEY=your_app_key
VITE_PUSHER_CLUSTER=us2
```

**Netlify Production:**
```bash
npx netlify env:set PUSHER_APP_ID your_app_id
npx netlify env:set PUSHER_KEY your_app_key
npx netlify env:set PUSHER_SECRET your_app_secret
npx netlify env:set PUSHER_CLUSTER us2
```

### 3. Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:8888
# Register new user → Should see welcome notification
```

### 4. Deploy to Production
```bash
npx netlify deploy --prod
# Test registration in production
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Notification system is extensible. Easy to add:

1. **Appointment Notifications:**
   - Create appointment → notify pet owner
   - 24h before → send reminder (can add cron job)
   - Vet cancels → notify owner
   - Vet reschedules → notify owner

2. **Medical Notifications:**
   - Vet adds clinical record → notify owner
   - Vaccination overdue → notify owner
   - Medication refill needed → notify owner

3. **Email Integration:**
  - High priority notifications → also send email
   - Daily digest of unread notifications

4. **Push Notifications:**
   - Browser push API for web
   - Mobile push for future React Native app

5. **User Preferences:**
   - Let users mute certain notification types
   - Choose email vs in-app vs push

6. **Admin Broadcast:**
   - Send notification to all users (system maintenance)
   - Send to specific user type (all pet owners, all vets)
